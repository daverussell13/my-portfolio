Scheduled feeding is a feature that allows users to create automatic feeding schedules for specific days, times, and minutes with customizable portion sizes. Users can also delete previously set schedules, offering flexibility to tailor feeding times according to the pet owner's preferences.

### Bluetooth Pairing

Bluetooth pairing is a feature designed to connect the device to available internet networks in its vicinity. This configuration needs to be done only once, and thereafter, the device will remember the SSID and password, attempting to establish a connection automatically every time it's powered on.

Here's a prototype showcase of the automatic pet feeder device. In this setup, the ESP32 serves as the core microcontroller responsible for managing the timed opening and closing of the food compartment. Additionally, a microservo acts as the primary driver for the food compartment door. You can find the project demonstration <a className="text-primary underline" href="#live">Here</a>.
